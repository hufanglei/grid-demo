    Jenkinsfile Runner Action for GitHub Actions aims at providing customized environments and useful GitHub Actions for the users. Therefore, users can execute the Jenkins pipeline in the GitHub Actions runners. It enables running Jenkins pipelines in a Function-as-a-Service context. Users can customize their environment by setting up base images, configuring the Jenkins Configuration-as-Code plugin, extending vanilla images or providing initial hooks for the temporary Jenkins controller. Several examples about how to set up secrets, Jenkins plugins and integrate with other GitHub Actions can be seen below. This project is based on the Jenkinsfile runner, which is a command line tool for the Jenkins pipeline execution engine.
    Jenkinsfile Runner Action for GitHub Actions help users fetch necessary dependencies, and wrap the entrypoint for Jenkinsfile Runner in one GitHub Action. Users can use them in the workflow definitions just like other GitHub Actions. Based on this big idea, I developed five GitHub Actions.
